# HOWDOIGETHOME
Do you commute to work? Do you encounter a lot of traffic on your way/way back? Do you end up taking different routes everyday? Do you check Google Maps after/before work to check the fastest route?

If you answered yes to most of those questions, you're just like me. I created this script to text me directions from work to get home. Just store your credentials/detials in a .env file exactly like the .env.example file, and run the python code from the command line. Tested on Python 2.7.

The scheduler can be modified to the time of your choice. 

## Setup
At the command line in the directory with these files
`python directions.py &`

The script will run in the background, indefinitely. Don't forget to restart the script if you reboot.
