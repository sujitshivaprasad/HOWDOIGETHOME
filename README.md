# HOWDOIGETHOME
Do you commute to work? Do you encounter a lot of traffic on your way/way back? Do you end up taking different routes everyday? Do you check Google Maps after/before work to check the fastest route?

If you answered yes to most of those questions, you're just like me. I created this script to text me directions from work to get home. Just store your credentials/detials in a .env file exactly like the .env.example file, and run the python code from the command line. Tested on Python 2.7.

The goal is to make this code live on a server (maybe Heroku) so it can send me these texts at 5 pm every weekday. TBD
